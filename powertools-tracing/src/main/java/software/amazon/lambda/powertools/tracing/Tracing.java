 * <p>{@code Tracing} provides functionality to reduce the overhead
 * of performing common tracing tasks.</p>

 * <p>{@code Tracing} should be used with the handleRequest method of a class
 * which implements either
 * {@code com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler} or
 * {@code com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestStreamHandler}.</p>
 *
 * <p>By default {@code Tracing} will capture responses and add them
 * to a sub segment named after the method.</p>
 *
 * <p>To disable this functionality you can specify {@code @Tracing( captureResponse = false)}</p>

 * <p>By default {@code Tracing} will capture errors and add them
 * to a sub segment named after the method.</p>

 * <p>All traces have a namespace set. If {@code @Tracing( namespace = "ExampleService")} is set
 * this takes precedent over any value set in the environment variable {@code POWER_TOOLS_SERVICE_NAME}.
 * If both are undefined then the value will default to {@code service_undefined}</p>
